While I was working on my n-body orbit simulator, my reading about dynamical systems and chaos inspired me to try to implement an encryption scheme based on chaotic systems. I've gone through several iterations, most of which didn't end up panning out. I'm still working on this project, and I hope to keep adding to it as I study dynamical systems further. Check out the full code [here](https://github.com/dhpitt/chaos-encryption-scheme)!
