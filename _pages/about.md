Hi! I'm David Pitt, a junior at Harvey Mudd College in Claremont, CA. In school, I'm pursuing a joint degree in math and computer science, with a focus in applied math and artificial intelligence. I'm a naturally curious person and I love researching and modeling cool phenomena. Over the last year, this has led me to investigate the Three-Body Problem, novel singularly perturbed fractals, EEG emotion recognition and much more. 

Outside of school, I'm interested in rock climbing, running, cooking and the electric guitar.
