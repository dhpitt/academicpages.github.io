Hey! I'm David Pitt, a sophomore at Harvey Mudd College in Claremont, CA. I love math and I'm fascinated by the idea of modeling the natural world. In school, I'm pursuing a joint degree in math and computer science, with a focus on applied math. I'm also concentrating in cognitive science, and I have a long-term goal to study circuit neuroscience, applying quantitative skills to develop a better biomechanical understanding of cognition. 

======

I plan for this site to be a landing page to showcase my work. Right now there isn't much here, but hopefully as I progress through school I'll continue to add interesting projects that I've done. If you're interested in any of what you see here, it's all on my GitHub and I'd be happy to answer any questions you might have.
