Hi! I'm David Pitt, a junior at Harvey Mudd College in Claremont, CA. In school, I'm pursuing a joint degree in math and computer science, with a focus on applied math. I'm a naturally curious person and I love researching and modeling cool phenomena. Over the last year, this has led me to investigate the Three-Body Problem, chaotic encryption hashing and novel fractals. 

My interests outside of school include the equity markets, cooking and trail running.

I plan for this site to be a landing page to showcase my work. Right now there isn't much here, but hopefully as I progress through school I'll continue to add projects that I've done. If you're interested in any of what you see here, it's all on my GitHub and I'd be happy to answer any questions you might have.
